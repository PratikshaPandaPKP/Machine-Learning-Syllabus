**Overview:**

This collection of PowerPoint presentations covers the full syllabus for the Machine Learning course for MSc students (SIES College of Commerce and Economics). The course is divided into five units, each focusing on different aspects of machine learning, from foundational concepts to advanced models and techniques. 

**Unit Breakdown:**

**Unit 1: Introduction to Machine Learning**
This unit introduces the core concepts and structure of machine learning. 

**Topics include:**

Definitions and examples of machine learning problems
Learning vs. designing, training vs. testing
Characteristics of machine learning tasks
Predictive and descriptive tasks
Machine learning models (Geometric, Logical, Probabilistic)
Feature engineering: types, construction, transformation, and selection

Unit 2: Classification and Regression
This unit delves into supervised learning techniques, covering:

Binary classification and performance assessment
Class probability estimation and multi-class classification
Regression analysis, performance metrics, and error measures
Overfitting and methods to avoid it, including a case study on polynomial regression
Theory of generalization, hypothesis growth function, VC dimension
Unit 3: Linear Models and Support Vector Machines
In this unit, you will explore:

Linear regression and multivariate linear regression
Regularization techniques for regression
Application of least squares regression in classification
Perceptron and support vector machines (SVMs), soft margin SVMs
Kernel methods for handling non-linearity in classifiers
Unit 4: Logic-Based, Algebraic, and Distance-Based Models
This unit focuses on:

Nearest neighbors and distance-based classification
K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering
Rule-based models for classification and subgroup discovery
Tree-based models, including probability estimation trees, regression trees, and clustering trees
Unit 5: Probabilistic Models and Advanced Techniques
The final unit covers advanced topics, including:

Probabilistic models and their geometric interpretation
Maximum likelihood and probabilistic models with hidden variables
Estimation-Maximization methods, Gaussian mixtures, and compression-based models
Bagging, boosting, multitask learning, and online learning
Introduction to deep learning and reinforcement learning
